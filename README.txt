This code was designed to analyze real stock market data from excel files. 
It is divided by three modules:
-----------------------
***Module 1 ("Módulo1") returns the yearly overview of all the tickers listed.

***Module 2 ("Módulo2") returns the greatest increase and decrease value stock, as well as the 
maximum stock total from all the tickers listed, after the Module 1 ran.

***Module 3 ("Módulo3") is the main sub routine which calls the previous modules and iterates over
all the sheets of a workbook.

Thanks!
