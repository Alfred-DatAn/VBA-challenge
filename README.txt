This code was designed to analyze real stock market data from excel files. 
It is divided by three modules:
-----------------------
***module_1 returns the yearly overview of all the tickers listed.

***module_2 returns the greatest increase and decrease value stock, as well as the 
maximum stock total from all the tickers listed, after the Module 1 ran.

***module_3 is the main sub routine which calls the previous modules and iterates over
all the sheets of a workbook.

Thanks!
